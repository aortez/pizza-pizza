This project is just an experiment to learn Go.

The idea is to build a little neural network testbed,
in which it controls an organism that is looking for food.

The app is intended to be published at allan.pizza to replace the aging
webcomponents-based implementation that is currently there.

# Building
The output target is WASM, build it like so:
```
./build.sh
```
